# Campaign Plugin for Craft CMS

Campaign is an email marketing plugin built specifically for Craft. It aims to bring the distribution of content by email into the CMS, where we believe it should be, along with the same ethos of flexibility and user-friendliness that Craft does. 

- Complete control and personalisation of emails using Twig templates.
- Integrates seamlessly with Amazon SES, Mailgun, Mandrill, Sendgrid, etc.
- Unlimited campaigns, subscribers, mailing lists and sendouts.
